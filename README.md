## Course Description ##

The purpose of the AP course in statistics is to introduce students to the major concepts and tools for collecting, analyzing and drawing conclusions from data. Students are exposed to four broad conceptual themes:
 1. Exploring Data: Describing patterns and departures from patterns
 2. Sampling and Experimentation: Planning and conducting a study
 3. Anticipating Patterns: Exploring random phenomena using probability and simulation
 4. Statistical Inference: Estimating population parameters and testing hypotheses

[Career Center](http://wsfcs.k12.nc.us/Domain/104) offers AP Statistics as a year-long course, which is equivalent to a one-semester, introductory, non-calculus based, college course in statistics.

## Prerequisites and Necessary Skills ##

* Completed or enrolled in Pre-Calculus.
* Working knowledge of algebra sufficient to use it as a tool when solving problems.
* Working knowledge of geometry sufficient for finding areas of basic shapes.

## Tools for Calculating and Computing ##

* Students will need access to a [graphing calculator](https://github.com/APStats/syllabus/calculator) during the course and for the advanced placement exam. 
* Career Center enjoys a sitewide JMP license, which students may use to complete assignments and projects.  
* Instructor is introducing GitHub with students this year


## Course Overview ##

This course is equivalent to a rigorous, non-calculus based, college introductory statistics course. Students will learn standard distribution-based inference procedures, including

## Homework and other Assignments ##

* All assignments will be posted on Canvas and listed on the due date for consistency throughout the year. ALL ASSIGNMENTS ARE DUE AT THE START OF CLASS ON THE DUE DATE, UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.
  * Textbook homework assignments may be done as traditional math homework on notebook paper or in a spiral notebook (student's choice for how to organize). 
  * Canvas assignments that are to be handed in electronically on Canvas will have the submit button available. When appropriate, students will usually be given options such as editing a text box, attaching a document, providing link to GoogleDoc, or attaching an audio or video file. 
  * Programming assignments that are submitted on GitHub will use the following workflow:
    * Fork the repository for the exercise/project (found under github.com/APStats).
    * Clone the repository to your computer.
    * Open the index.html file in a browser and open the Developer Tools.
    * Modify the files to complete your solution.
    * Refresh the index.html page to see results and repeat.
    * Make sure all of your code is committed.
    * Push/sync up to GitHub.
    * Create a pull request on the original repository.
    * You may continue to push fixes and improvements until the due date - just add a comment in the pull request to let me know it has been updated.
